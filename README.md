## AI Live Meeting
### What problem am I trying to address?
I noticed the difficulty to **quickly interact with peers** during multi-user livestream videos (e.g. Zoom, Google meet). For example, in a online class scenario, if a user want to raise hand to ask a question, the user has to click the **emoji button -> select emoji -> deselect emoji (three steps)** to complete the user flow of interaction with the professor.
### How can AI help to solve this problem?
An AI algorithm, potentially computer vision to classify users’ hand postures, and to directly emit signals to the peers.
### What data is needed to create an AI to help address the issue?
A series of input data that is able to precisely conclude humans’ hand postures.
